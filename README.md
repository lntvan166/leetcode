# LeetCode Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in Go (Golang).

## Overview

I'm using this repository to practice and improve my Go programming skills by solving LeetCode problems. Each solution is designed to demonstrate my approach to problem-solving using Go.

## Structure

- **`/problems`** : Contains directories named after each LeetCode problem number.
- Each problem directory includes a `README.md` with the problem statement.
- A `*.go` file contains the Go implementation of the solution.

## Usage

To explore the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lntvan166/leetcode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific problem directory:

   ```bash
   cd leetcode/problems/{problem-number}

   ```

3. Read the problem description in `README.md` and review the solution in `solution.go`.
4. Run and test the solution locally, if applicable.
